A SQL project on a logistic company would involve creating a database to manage various aspects of the company's operations, such as tracking shipments, managing inventory, and handling customer orders. The project would involve designing a schema that captures the necessary information for each of these areas, and then implementing the schema using SQL to create tables, views, and queries. The goal of the project would be to provide the company with a centralized system for managing its logistics operations and improving efficiency and accuracy.
